# TD Learning to Find Car Control Policy Based on Local Information


This is a reinforcement learning course project by me (Jameson Thies), Kourosh Vali and Yanda Chen. It uses n-step TD learning for an agent to teach a simplified car model how to navigate a track. A Pygame interface shows the agents actions in the training and testing epsiodes depending on th train and test functions used.
